In western ethics, integrity is regarded as the quality of having an intuitive sense of honesty and truthfulness in regard to the motivations for one's actions. Integrity can be regarded as the opposite of hypocrisy, in that it regards internal consistency as a virtue, and suggests that parties holding apparently conflicting values should account for the discrepancy or alter their beliefs.\r\n\r\nThe word \"integrity\" stems from the Latin adjective integer (whole, complete). In this context, integrity is the inner sense of \"wholeness\" deriving from qualities such as honesty and consistency of character. As such, one may judge that others \"have integrity\" to the extent that one judges whether they behave according to the values, beliefs and principles they claim to hold.", "education1": ["Studied Applied science at Jean de Br\u00e9boeuf"], "education2": [], "work1": ["C.E.O at Griffin Business Solutions15 March 2017 - Present\u00b7Westmount, Quebec", "C.E.O at Griffin Business Solutions", "Griffin Business Solutions", "15 March 2017 - Present\u00b7Westmount, Quebec", "15 March 2017 - Present\u00b7", "15 March 2017 - Present", "Westmount, Quebec"], "work2": ["C.E.O at Griffin Business Solutions15 March 2017 - Present\u00b7Westmount, Quebec", "C.E.O at Griffin Business Solutions", "Griffin Business Solutions", "15 March 2017 - Present\u00b7Westmount, Quebec", "15 March 2017 - Present\u00b7", "15 March 2017 - Present", "Westmount, Quebec"]}
