I was in that situation more often than I'd like to admit. \r\n\r\nThese are very common issues for ordinary hard-working people. Just a few months ago I was in the same situation, making it by living PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK, working 15+ hours a day, full of debt, missing out on my family's life and personally felt very unhappy.\r\n\r\nI didn't know this back then, but somewhere along the way without knowing it I created and adjusted to my comfort zone. I had WORKED HARD to put a roof over my head, food in the fridge, and drive a decent car ...when life is good, why change it right?\r\n\r\nWhat I failed to realize is that as a result I stopped seeking, stretching and reaching for more, I decided to glide through life choosing the EASY PATH avoiding resistance and discomfort.\r\n\r\nYou see, I had stopped growing but my spending never did and EVENTUALLY I was full of debt trapped in a never ending rat race of working to pay bills.\r\n\r\nOn September of 2016 while considering going back to school and getting into even more debt, I had a DEEP TALK with my friend and mentor Alfredo Delgado. He was a minimum wage worker (now a 7-figure earner) and he shared his story of how he once struggled just as I did but had found his way to financial and time freedom.\r\n\r\nHe was 100% real with me saying it wasn't going to be easy in the beginning but it will be well worth it in the end. He's not the type to FLASH a fancy car, a mansion full of snotty people or throwing money around ...just him and his life story.\r\n\r\nHe had a face-to-face talk with me where he explained how he managed to turn his life around. Today he is not only my AWESOME mentor but also a close friend. He has shown me everything I know today and I owe him where I find myself today.\r\n\r\nI've been able to create a few powerful online businesses that has given me and those on my team the time freedom and financial freedom we deserve. \r\n\r\nAm I a millionaire? NO! \r\n\r\nBut I do have true freedom, which I value way more.. but the MILLIONS are coming JUST WATCH!!!! \r\n\r\nFAST FORWARD...\r\n\r\nNow I work from my laptop or smartphone where and when I want, I'm debt free, always available for my wife and kids and I couldn't be more EXCITED about my future! Now I'm able to spend more time doing the things I love to do, where and when I want rather than being stuck at work all day.\r\n\r\nPlus, instead of buying a Lamborghini or a mansion to show off, I'm working on making my money GROW EVEN MORE by investing in properties and creating other streams of income. Pretty soon my money will be working for me even when I'm SLEEPING! I made my financial decisions by taking advice from business pros, not celebrities! \r\n\r\nThe best thing is that I used simple, time-tested methods, tools and systems to build my business. Methods, tools, and systems that are available to anyone. But even though the dream is FREE, the hustle is sold SEPARATELY. You gotta EARN IT! \r\n\r\nYou must entertain the idea that your dreams and goals can still come true REGARDLESS of your age, education or skill level because the life that you want for yourself and your loved ones is only one step outside of your comfort zone.\r\n\r\nI stopped worrying about what others thought or said about me and my businesses and DID ME! Two things I learned in this industry is that you have to have TOUGH skin and also people's opinions will NEVER cut me a check!\r\n\r\nIf you're interested in learning about a REAL solution and learning about how I created TRUE FREEDOM, I'll layout the blueprint for ANYONE who has the drive and motivation for success. \r\n\r\nINBOX ME and let me help you make a difference in your current situation! \r\n\r\nMy name is Cory \"Cee The Vision\" Winston and this is my STORY and this is my TRUTH! \r\n\r\nCory \"Cee The Vision\" Winston\r\n\"Work Hard Now And The Rest Is Easy Later!\"\r\n#ceethevision", "education1": ["Studied Advanced Marine Engineering at Coastline Military ProgramsSchool year 2014", "Studied Advanced Marine Engineering at Coastline Military Programs", "Coastline Military Programs", "School year 2014"], "education2": [], "work1": ["Head of Marketing Operations at Bellativa LLCMarch 2017 - Present", "Head of Marketing Operations at Bellativa LLC", "March 2017 - Present"], "work2": ["Head of Marketing Operations at Bellativa LLCMarch 2017 - Present", "Head of Marketing Operations at Bellativa LLC", "March 2017 - Present"]}
