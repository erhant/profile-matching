Although the world is full of suffering, it is full also of the overcoming of it and we could never learn to be brave and patient if there were only joy in the world.  \n\nOne can never consent to creep when one feels an impulse to soar. Life is either a daring adventure or nothing at all and my friends have made the story of my life. I realise that when one door of happiness closes, another opens; but often we look so long at the closed door that we do not see the one which has been opened for us.\n\nFace your deficiencies and acknowledge them; but do not let them master you. Let them teach you patience, sweetness, insight. Be of good cheer. Do not think of today's failures, but of the success that may come tomorrow. You have set yourselves a difficult task, but you will succeed if you persevere; and you will find a joy in overcoming obstacles. \n\nRemember that Optimism is the faith that leads to achievement whereas self-pity is our worst enemy and if we yield to it, we can never do anything good in the world. \n\nKeep your face to the sun and you will never see the shadows.\"\n\nA tribute to Helen Keller and her inspirational story.
