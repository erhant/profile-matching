I do what i want. I do it with who i want and i don't really give a shit what you think about that.\n\nTattooed and Tempered\n\nI enjoy each and every day I am blessed with. Generally speaking, I am where I want to be. If i wanted to be somewhere else, Id be there.\n\nI am a family man. I spend most of my time training jiu jitsu. The rest of the time is spent with family and friends barbecuing and watching fights, football, baseball or basketball.\n\nWhat I enjoy most has nothing to do with professional teams and everything to do with my God Daughter and my nieces and nephews. I am a fan of theirs more than I am a fan of anyone else. Watching them learn about life on and off the field or court takes priority in my day.\n\nI love going to UFC Fights, Lakers and Dodger Games. There is nothing like live events. i don't care which college team is playing... Ill definitely be rooting for the home teams... GO LA\n\nI refuse to be defined by my family, my friends, my tattoos, my culture or by YOU. I am a unique individual. i do everything because i want to, not because someone says i have to. I am a friend who can listen, I am a lover who can fight.  I know how to laugh, at both myself and at others. I am a man who's word you can take to the bank. The only side ill take is the side of truth. I am someone my family and friends can depend on. I think I'm fun to be with and funny at times. i give freely to those i feel deserve my gifts. I'll do things most other people wont (except eating stupid shit). Judge me by my appearance and you'll surely be surprised once you have gotten to know me. Judge me by my actions and well be friends for life.\n\nI am single and ready to mingle. If your not sexy and confident with a great personality... Im sure there is someone out there for you.. but keep it moving please. We can all hang out and have a great time... but I'm looking for a dime. I don't need to be in a relationship to be happy... I am doing just fine on my own... but I know I could use a girl who can motivate and inspire me to be the best man I can be. If u have any young sexy friends u think deserve an awesome guy... send em my way... and ill get back to ya... :)\n\nAt the end of it all... I am a son, a brother, an uncle, a cousin, and a God Father. Ill see what else God has in store for me.", "education1": ["No schools/universities to show"], "education2": [], "work1": ["No workplaces to show"], "work2": ["No workplaces to show"]}
