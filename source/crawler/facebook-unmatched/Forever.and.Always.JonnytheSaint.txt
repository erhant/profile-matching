Love it and do it Justice. Jonny the Saint's love of music is what pushes his combination of so many different styles of music in his songwriting. Each song tells you a story and has the right vibe to go with it.\n\nGrowing up in a family that owned a local infamous corner bar he was able to see live bands performing on a regular basis from the local piano man to full blown rock and roll bands at an early age. Those memories set the high expectations of how music affected people and made for a great time! The pictures of the bands passing the hat to play more songs, singing along with piano player as everybody got involved in the performances had a lasting effect on Jonny the Saint from a young age.\n\nIt was just a matter of time before he started experimenting with music. Playing in local bands covering some of his favorite songs with the passion he gained from his memories of growing up seeing these great bands in his parent's corner bar performing. Soon enough he started writing his own songs with the expectations of his childhood memories and how he saw music affect the audience from beginning to end of a performance.\n\nThe first release from Jonny the Saint was the full length title \u201cBig Old World\u201d. The songs had a great vibe, and tons of energy. Sharing the stage with some great bands he gained a fan base all over the east coast. The experience and knowledge gained from years of hard work has helped him grow as an artist and songwriter with each performance.\n\nRiding the success of his debut \u201cBig Old World\u201d Jonny the Saint relocated to Texas to work on his craft and the follow up to \u201cBig Old World\u201d. The influence of the southern music was a great addition to his influences, which came across when he released \u201cOld School New\u201d A tight set of soulful songs that took you deeper than anything on \u201cBig Old World\u201d had touched upon. With songs such as \u201cPreacher Man\u201d, and \u201cGone Away\u201d Jonny the Saint was repeating the success he had with his debut release. Soon enough he was drawing big crowds all over the south wherever he played.\n\nWorking on his craft, JTS has sharpened his blade once again while working on his latest disc \u201cTuff Love\u201d. He has dug in deep to come out with some great new songs focusing on themes of unity, friendship, and overcoming life's obstacles we face everyday. It seems like JTS is ready to go at it again and take everybody with him as he tells his stories in song that started years ago in a little corner bar in a Pennsylvania coal mining town.\n", "education1": ["Studied at Luzerne County Community College", "Luzerne County Community College"], "education2": [], "work1": ["Branch manager at First Home Bank21 August 2019 - Present\u00b7Hurst, Texas", "Branch manager at First Home Bank", "First Home Bank", "21 August 2019 - Present\u00b7Hurst, Texas", "21 August 2019 - Present\u00b7", "21 August 2019 - Present", "Hurst, Texas"], "work2": ["Branch manager at First Home Bank21 August 2019 - Present\u00b7Hurst, Texas", "Branch manager at First Home Bank", "First Home Bank", "21 August 2019 - Present\u00b7Hurst, Texas", "21 August 2019 - Present\u00b7", "21 August 2019 - Present", "Hurst, Texas"]}
