This is presumably useful, which totally makes sense, when you have a wide gamut display but your OS uses say sRGB. Should we be surprised that OS color profile can be overwritten without root privilege?1", "ColorSync is pretty frustrating to work with. You'd think the \"Phosphor values\" under the \"Apple display native information\" are the XYZ of the actual primaries used by the display.
