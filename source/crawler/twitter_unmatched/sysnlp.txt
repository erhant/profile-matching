We are building more accurate and reliable energy estimation tools that are easy to use without extra hardware efforts. Stay tuned!\n#SustaiNLP #EMNLP2020 #NLProc1", "4/5 We use a hardware power meter to measure energy accurately and quantify the error (>20%) of existing software measurements. We find current software measurements without calibration are inaccurate and cause misleading design choices. \n#SustaiNLP #EMNLP2020 #NLProc1", "3/5 Existing utilization-based software methods do not address issues like power lag, tail energy issues. Non-utilization behaviors such as data movement in GPUs also cause energy. Resource profiling should avoid high overhead.\n#SustaiNLP #EMNLP2020 #NLProc1", ""]}
