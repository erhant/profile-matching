We propose a specialized model architecture, called Voyager, to handle the unique problems that irregular data prefetching poses for machine learning.Show this thread519", "Congrats to Zhan Shi who led this effort and collaborators at @UTCompSci (Calvin) and @Google (@miladhash , @kswersk and Partha)12", "Just like innovative model architectures, such as AlexNet and VGG, spurred innovation in computer vision, we hope this will be a first step in building neural models customized for computer architecture problems.12", "Voyager improves IPC by nearly 42% on irregular programs, including, hard-to-prefetch Google workloads. While currently infeasible for hardware deployment, Voyager shows how much more can be done for prefetching and points to some interesting insights.2", "Excited to announce our upcoming @ASPLOSConf paper on building neural models for high-coverage irregular data prefetching!
